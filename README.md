# Braedon's Really Good Bash Script for a Node Server in TS

It's really friggen nice, try it out

## How does this work tho????

clone project to your computer: `git clone git@github.com:braedongough/init-node-ts.git`

-   cd into project and run: `cp init-node-ts.sh /usr/local/bin/init-node-ts`

-   init-node-ts takes one arg for name of CRA project. eg.
    `init-node-ts call-your-mom-she-misses-you`

-   wam bam thank you ma'am, you've got a server ready to run on localhost:3000
